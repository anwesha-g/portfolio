          </div>
          <p>Project: 1.19 Algorithms & Art <br> Course: AP CSP (AP Computer Science Principles) <br> Duration: Approximately 1.5 months (Mid September 2020 - Early November 2020) <br> Objective: By incorporating the turtle module, abide by the rules of the Create task, and inform the audience of a real-world event, through imagery. <br> Type of Project: Partner Project</p>
          <p> <b> - </b> </p>
          <p> For this turtle project, we had to choose a real-life event impactful upon the world. The recent developments in the science and technology field with Crispr-Cas9 was interesting to us, and the invention had earned Jennifer Dodna a Nobel Prize, one of the highest honors possible to citizens. The criteria to be met according to the rubric was the usage of user input, lists and functions. Thus, we designed a banner, with Doda’s picture in the middle as a representation of the honor Doda has just received with the Nobel Prize. Above the banner, there is a DNA strand, depicting the main purpose of Crispr, a genome/DNA editing program. This DNA strand was created with the use of 4 function calls with different parameters to create the corresponding dips. Then, a test tube is created, to symbolize the Nobel Prize within the chemistry field. Above the test tube and banner, an animated scissor is created to demonstrate Crispr’s cutting motions that “snip” away at DNA, to edit it. Finally, on the right corner, a magnifying glass with randomly colored rectangles on a shorter piece of DNA appears. Here on this magnifying glass, facts are displayed based on user input through the terminal, to teach the user. To organize the information displayed to the user, lists were used to cut down and strip information. This functionality can be demonstrated in the video. More understanding upon different trials and models of the program can be found in its documentation. I specifically worked upon the user functionality and integration with the Turtle canvas, helping create the randomly-colored DNA within the magnifying glass. I also animated the scissors to cut as well as it could appear, proving some challenges as animating in Turtle isn’t exactly possible. This required creating different frames of the scissors, and piecing them together on the canvas with sequencing. A challenge solved logically was animating the bubbles within the test-tube, as these pieces were simpler overall. By creatively avoiding animation itself and making each of the bubbles separate turtle objects, and moving them across the canvas visually, this challenge was reached. However, we had a goal of trying to create a Greek-styled wreath, with leaves of different sizes and curves. Due to the math required to make this wreath come to life with Turtle, (differential equations), a different tactic was used to give a different look to the badge. I solved this by using nested for-loops and incrementing variables to recreate a simplistic version of this look. Together, by communicating and splitting the work evenly, while working together, this project was completed. We coded separately, meaning we had to discuss every piece out in pseudo code incredibly well, to make sure variable names and ideas were able to come together to join as a whole.</p>
