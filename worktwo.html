          <p>Project: Hangman Practice Create Task <br> Course: AP CSP (AP Computer Science Principles) <br> Duration: Approximately 3 weeks <br> Objective: Create a Hangman game that abides by the AP Create Task Rubric, utilizing user input, a function with at least one parameter, and uses a list.<br> Type of Project: Partner Project</p>
          <p> <b> - </b> </p>
          <p> Tasked to create a Hangman game, this project seemed relatively easy on the outside. However, meeting the rubric requirements was the catch. To add a layer of complexity, to challenge ourselves, we pushed ourselves to not just make a game through terminal, but a visually appealing Hangman game with the Turtle module. This meant that we would not be typing user input through the terminal, but with the onkeypress() function. Though another added level of complexity, our group was up for the challenge. First, we aimed to have the game functioning without the onkeypress() function first, then add the layer of complexity, as per SCRUM process. Our first sprint created a functioning hangman, although crude, which randomly selected a word from secret_list for the user to guess. Depending if the inputted letter was present in the word (and was saved in another list), part of the Hangman would be drawn visually on screen. We faced the challenge of trying to code the hangman game such that the hangman features would appear in order. After brainstorming together, I helped add to the program with an idea of creating a list that would remove elements in index order, and use an if-statement and for-loop to take the next available feature out of the list, directly correlating to a set of turtle instructions to complete. This solved that issue. Once we were able to meet the bare minimum, we added another sprint to challenge ourselves, and I decided that adding a scoreboard to depict time remaining as well as wins and losses would add to the game. I used the random module to create an ellipse that would change random colors and display output based on what parts of a function would be triggered by sequencing and iteration. We faced an issue of the writing sometimes passing behind the color, which is described more in depth within our documentation as well. In this sprint, I also helped the user input area, using lambda to take multiple arguments in our main function. By the end, after lots of collaboration and arriving upon challenges, our Hangman game was functioning thanks to the SCRUM process, as visible in our video. </p>
