                  <h3>Hello, I'm Anwesha.</h3>
                  <p>There is something undeniably attractive about risk. The burning rush of a feeling, the feeling of finding something new, creating something unbelievable from scratch. From making automated wings with hydraulics from paint stirrers to reading about companies developing the internet from hot air balloons. The risk, the rush of adrenaline that comes with finding new things keeps me going. Especially in subjects such as science and computer science. I’ve always loved Star Wars as a child, and I’ve wanted to fly the Millenium Falcon alongside Hans Solo and Chewie for as long as I can remember. I know that building the Falcon itself may not be feasible, but the idea of aeronautics, my Star Wars childhood, it holds me. With some previous exposure, I want to study microorganisms even more, as they feel like unwalked territory. I hope to major at the cross sections of Aeronautics or Microbiology with applied Computer Science, and specifically do research on maintaining life outside of Earth or working with microorganisms to harvest clean energy. To do so, I hope to graduate Dublin High with an Engineering certificate and deep-dive into Biology or Physics. I would like to conduct research alongside a professor upon biophysics at some point. I would like to apply the biology or physics I learn with computer science, in a way to help the world in any way I can. <br> <br>
                  I remember completely breaking down about my science fair project, the realization that I would need to be able to showcase a project within a month feeling like ice down my back. My mind kept running back to how all the other competitors seemed to have it all figured out, with mentors guiding them. My confidence was shattering, and without a mentor guiding me, I felt like a fish on land. Some part of me wanted to give out, and just pretend that I never signed up for this, but it didn’t sit right with me to leave something midway. It reminded me that whenever I felt like letting my interests become my demons, that I was trying to go around a mountain that only had one way through. Curiosity kept me going, the urge to finish things I started. Most importantly, the satisfaction of working with electronics and microbiology. The idea of harvesting energy without burning fossil fuels through manipulating currents and bacteria, that curiosity, kept me motivated. It’s a reminder that giving up is the choice of a coward, but the need to test this idea kept me till the end, actually locking myself a spot as a State CSEF Fair Nominee and Honorable Mention, Project Planet Environment Award, and first at ACSEF. The hands-on research experienced gifted me more than any of the awards could ever mean. Through this experience, I learnt the importance of ambition, determination and risk taking. Innovators don’t make things from what already exists. When my team at Destination Imagination was awarded the Da Vinci Award at States this year for outstanding creativity and innovation, I felt like I could never stop loving what I was doing. I quickly found that I enjoyed coding and creating, and understanding why and how the world works around us. From my 8th grade science teacher who understood this, I was recommended to read Campbell's Biology textbook. From recommendations, I joined the USA Biology Olympiad, and soon I found myself in a Science Olympiad team as well. Exploring gives me a will to continue searching, to continue learning. To continue striving forward, and not afraid to look back upon the past in shame. From researching hands-on with computer science application projects such as my microbial project to deep-diving online with CTFs keeps my mind at play. Wireshark problems are my specialty, since I pay attention to detail, making this all the more fun. This stemmed from my background in CyberPatriot, where I have made 3-time Semifinalist and Finalist last year. We became the first middle school team to participate in the CalPoly Cyber Innovation Challenge. <br> <br>
                  Curiosity keeps my mind turning, it’s a reason why I push myself out of my comfort zone, outside of school. When I force myself into situations and projects I’ve never done before, I feel like I’m growing, like I’m collecting a special token from every experience I go through. The pleasure and risk of it all, the idea of trying things out even when it doesn’t seem right, with my background in Destination Imagination, reminds that there’s always more ahead.</p>
